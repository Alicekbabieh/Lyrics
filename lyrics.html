Lyrics:
        &#9834; I don’t do this often
        &#9833; You caught me
        &#9835; Off guard

        &#9834; All of my friends
        &#9833; said you moved out west
        &#9835; you tell me stories underneath sun sets

        &#9834; Could it be more than just one night 
        &#9833; Kiss in the cab ride
        &#9835; Head turning left right
        &#9834; Get a ticket for two 
        &#9833; To wherever you choose
        &#9835; Drinking some red out of the blue

        &#9836; You say my name with your accent
        &#9834; Makes me remember
        &#9833; How much I missed ya
        &#9835; Hope your planning to stay 
        &#9836; For a million days
        &#9834; You’ll be my summer in December
 
        &#9836; Hey Boy
        &#9834; Trust my intuitions
        &#9833; Always
        &#9835; I’m not super-stitious
        &#9836; I got lucky
        &#9834; Stole your heart
        &#9833; And it was mine for the taking
 
        &#9834; I’m bad at pretending
        &#9833; You know 
        &#9835; I’ll be true

        &#9834; Sunday mornings, midnight lights
        &#9833; Turn into songs that your watch me write
        &#9835; Stole your sweater on that night
        &#9834; You took a picture 
        &#9833; I keep by my bedside
        &#9835; So you’re mine when your gone
        &#9834; Baby please don’t be long
        &#9833; I got my ticket to the westside

        &#9836; You say my name with your accent
        &#9834; Makes me remember
        &#9833; How much I missed ya
        &#9835; Hope your planning to stay
        &#9836; For a million days
        &#9834; You’ll be my summer in December

        &#9836; Hey Boy
        &#9834; Trust my intuitions
        &#9833; Always
        &#9835; I’m not super-stitious
        &#9836; I got lucky
        &#9834; Stole your heart
        &#9833; And it was mine for the taking

        &#9836; It was mine for the taking,
        &#9834; It was mine for a million days. 
        &#9833; Hmm, in a million ways.

        &#9834; Stole your heart, and I got lucky.
        &#9833; Stole your heart and it was mine in a million ways. 
        &#9835; Hmm, for a million days.
