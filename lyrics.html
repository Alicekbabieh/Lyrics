        I don’t do this often
        You caught me
        Off guard

        All of my friends
        said you moved out west
        you tell me stories underneath sun sets

        Could it be more than just one night 
        Kiss in the cab ride
        Head turning left right
        Get a ticket for two 
        To wherever you choose
        Drinking some red out of the blue

        You say my name with your accent
        Makes me remember
        How much I missed ya
        Hope your planning to stay 
        For a million days
        You’ll be my summer in December
 
        Hey Boy
        Trust my intuitions
        Always
        I’m not super-stitious
        I got lucky
        Stole your heart
        And it was mine for the taking
 
        I’m bad at pretending
        You know 
        I’ll be true

        Sunday mornings, midnight lights
        Turn into songs that your watch me write
        Stole your sweater on that night
        You took a picture 
        I keep by my bedside
        So you’re mine when your gone
        Baby please don’t be long
        I got my ticket to the westside

        You say my name with your accent
        Makes me remember
        How much I missed ya
        Hope your planning to stay
        For a million days
        You’ll be my summer in December

        Hey Boy
        Trust my intuitions
        Always
        I’m not super-stitious
        I got lucky
        Stole your heart
        And it was mine for the taking

        It was mine for the taking,
        It was mine for a million days. 
        Hmm, in a million ways.

        Stole your heart, and I got lucky.
        Stole your heart and it was mine in a million ways. 
        Hmm, for a million days.
